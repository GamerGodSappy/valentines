Your back too, when i saw u laying down on the pillows, on me and i pulled ur shirt up 🤯🤯 was my reaction (good way) your back made u look so sexy, and got me horny (i’m joking on that). When i was scratching ur back and u held me tighter 🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋, i loved it, and let me know u liked it too. I don’t know what it was abt it, but u letting ur guard down and being comfortable with me lifting up ur shirt even after all u been through, it just made me so happy that ur comfortable enough with me. I don’t know why i just loved thst moment so much, and made me smile. tdy made me realize what our future life could be, in decathlon wothout the worrying of being caught or the time pressure. You laying in my arms with your shoes off like a baby, i just couldn’t and had to kiss Your entire face. I love making out with you to, your really good at it u know that. can’t wait for the life waiting for us, when ur goijg to nyu and i’m going to mit, in our apartmet. I’m going to wake up to my besutoful wife, right next to me, in my hoodie and nothing but underwear and ur gonna wake up to me. shirtless. While ur sleeping ur going to feel me press up on to u and kiss your forhead, lips and ur neck. When i get up i’ll be making ur buldak, yes buldak for breakfast, and ur gonna wake up bc ur fatass is gonna smell it, i’m gonna hear you wake up, and run to u for a kiss, and then i’m gonna grab a HANDFUL, and pull u closer. Then i’m gonna let go and run circles on ur ass. Then run my hands up, ur shirt and run circles there. Then i’ll push u on to the bed coach behind u, and start making out with u with one of my hands in ur roots of ur hair and one on ur neck. Countinue ling down ur neck kissing you everywhere pulling up ur shirt kissing your Big FUCKING TITs, run my hands through them and the hold them and just admire them and how beautiful u are.

If your mad, sad, feeling down, or discustijg i’ll be there. Never ever think for a moment i would leave u because of the problems u have, ive ment thst i would never leave u because of the problems u hold, it just make me appreciate ur grift (ur presence) even more. You will never be alone, i know i might not always be enough, u will always have me in ur corner. i will never leave you. me and you against the world. Baby more importantly ur healing, u said nothing would get better remeber before i left u after tims. You can see the progress you made, you are healing. I want u to push as hard as u can before thinking abt falling and if ur half as strong as i think u are, ur going to make it out alive, with ur true self. Even if u don’t i’ll be right there to catch you if u do fall, and lift u right back up in ur feet. You deserve the world because of how much if a besutoful ee souled person you are, i know i say it a lot but it’s true. I can’t give it to you, but what i can do, is make you mine. Untill i can give it to you. I love you so much.

    <h1>Late Submission</h1>
    <p>Princess if you do not accept late work I understand but this is a very good paragraph so I think you should read this. When I started tslking to you in the CPSS group chat I didn't want to have the same schedule, because u didn't seem nice. Thst all changed when I first laid eyes on you, you were the prettiest girl I have ever met. Your smile, your hair, your eyes, all got me falling in love with you, that I didn't know were possible. After you actually texted me, my first assumption of you not being nice, I took all of it back. That's when I knew Iloved you. Now every time I smell vanilla I can't stop think of you. October 15 marked the happiest day of my life, and will be a day thst I will never forget ever. All the time I spent freezing cold to met u was worth every second, and every second I almost got lost. The first time we went to the movies we weren't allowed to go, but we managed to go. When you wrapped your arm around mine and rested your head on my shoulder. fa :)) I love you. I can't wait for you to get back and u can sit in my lap and we can cuddling and u can tell me everything you have been bottling up, and not telling me. :( If 1 feel like I might also kiss you because you are absolutely amazing. Also DONT JUGE MY DRAWING OF A LILY. I'm not an artist like u. I love you my princess. Send a chat
